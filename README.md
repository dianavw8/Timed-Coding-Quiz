## Purpose

## Lessons Learned
The Timed Coding Quiz was a challenging web application, because there were so many details to the game that needed to work perfectly together in order for the web application to function properly. Working on HTML, CSS and JS from scratch was a great challenge that required many hours, tweaks and online searching until I felt the game was complete.
